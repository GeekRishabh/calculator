This is demo app Calculator based on React Native using React Native CLI and also with EXPO CLI .

# React Native

I have picked what I think is the best set of features , library or dependencies
to build basic calculator , continuity of technology, and absolutely beautiful and fast
products with no compromises in quality or capability.

## Requirements

1. OS X - This repo only contains the iOS implementation right now, and Xcode only runs on Mac.
2. New to Xcode? [Download it](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) from the Mac App Store.
3. [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is the recommended way to install node, watchman, and flow.
4. New to node or npm? `brew install node`
5. We recommend installing [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html), otherwise you might hit a node file watching bug. `brew install watchman`
6. If you want to use [flow](http://www.flowtype.org), `brew install flow`
7. If you want to run the Expo version you will need [expo CLI](https://expo.io/), `npm install -g expo-cli`

## Quick start

Get up and running with Calculator app:

- Once you have the repo cloned and met all the requirements above, start the
  packager that will transform your JS code on-the-fly:

```
npm install
```

### Running React Native App

#### IOS Simulator

1. Open the `Calculator/ReactNative/reactNative.xcodeproj` project in Xcode.
2. Make sure the target is set to `reactNative` and that you have an iOS simulator
   selected to run the app.
3. Build and run the project with the Xcode run button.

You should now see the Calculator app running on your iOS simulator.

#### Android Simulator / Device

1. Run `react-native run-android`

### Running Expo App

- Run `npm start`
- Scan the QR code in device with [Expo client](https://expo.io/tools#client)
